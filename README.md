    Canva
        Logo
        https://www.canva.com/

    *Since I only used a font through canva and worked with the free version, I am free to use this image. Though my logo image is not being used for trademark this is Canva's logo policy. 

        "A trademark has to be a unique symbol which is exclusively used by a brand owner. For that reason, you cannot use any Free or Pro content from Canvaâ€™s library in a trademark (except for fonts, basic shapes and lines). If you want to design a unique logo for a trademark, you can:
            Use any of our fonts
            Use basic shapes and lines
            Upload your own graphics (this might be a graphic you designed yourself, or commissioned from a local graphic designer)" 

Style Changes:
    Change 1
        On line 53, I rounded the edges of the Open world exploration image by using border-radius.

    Change 2
        On line 71, I changed the font of my first paragraph to Georgia.

    Change 3
        On line 95, I changed the size of the font on the second heading to x-large.

Headers
    My first header is "A LOCATION EQUALLY DISTANT..." on line 31 in html and line 59 in my style sheet. 

    My second header is "ABOUT THIS GAME" on line 51 in html and line 93 in my style sheet.

    I edited the image layout by first inserting my images above their corresponding text in my html sheet. Then, in my style sheet I made sure each image had width, border-radius,
    float, margin-right/left/top/bottom. This allowed me to position my picture on the right or left of the screen. It also allowed me to shift the image from the top, bottom, left,
    or right.
